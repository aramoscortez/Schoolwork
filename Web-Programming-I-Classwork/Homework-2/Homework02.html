            The Abduction of Rebecca by Eugene DelacroixThroughout his career, Delacroix was inspired by the novels of Sir Walter Scott, 
            a favorite author of the French Romantics. This painting depicts a scene from Ivanhoe: the Jewish heroine Rebecca, who had 
            been confined in the castle of Front de Boeuf (seen in flames), is carried off by two Saracen slaves commanded by the 
            covetous Christian knight Bois-Guilbert. The contorted, interlocking poses and compacted space, which shifts abruptly 
            from the elevated foregound to the fortress behind, create a sense of intense drama. Apart from the still life at lower left, 
            the only element of calm is Rebecca herself.

            Hagar and the Angel" by Francesco MaffeiMaffei, who lived and worked in the cities of Vicenza and Padua, was profoundly 
            influenced by the art of Bassano, Tintoretto, and Veronese, his Venetian predecessors. His style is characteristic for its 
            elegance, far removed from realism. This scene from the biblical book of Genesis shows the angel appearing to Hagar. Having 
            been banished by Abraham to the desert with her infant Ishmael, she is saved by a heavenly creature who directs her to a 
            spring of water.
